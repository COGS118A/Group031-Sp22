    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",

    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "Our goal is to classify hand signs in the American Sign Language. We're aiming to create an machine learning algotithm that can recoginize ASL hand signs and potentially be used in applications to help people with hearing disablity ot dificiency. The data are images of real hand symbols. It's Sign Language MNIST dataset with 34000 observations with 784 pixels each. We are going to use K-NN and possibly decision trees. We're planning to implement RandomForest and Keras libraries to train our model on the data. We'll divide our dataset into 27000+ training cases and about 7200 test cases to achieve our desired results.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "American Sign Language is expressed with hand signs. It is the primary language in the United States for people who are hard of hearing or deaf. In the United States, there are around 10 million people who are hard of hearing and around 1 million people who are functionally deaf<sup>[1]</sup>. Creating a machine learning algorithm that can recognize ASL hand signs can help these people. Some prior work that has occurred with American Sign Language recognition includes an implementation of an ASL translator on a web application based on a convolutional neural network classifier<sup>[2]</sup>. Due to a lack of variation in their dataset they were unable to reproduce the validation accuracies they observed during training when they were testing. They hypothesize that with a more robust dataset, their models would be able to generalize more accurately. Creating a machine learning algorithm that can accurately recognize American Sign Language signs can allow people who use ASL to communicate with people who do not know sign language. This will lead them to be able to communicate with a wider range of people that they were not able to do so previously.\n",
